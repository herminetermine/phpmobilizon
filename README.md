# phpmobilizon
Test-repo to try out GraphQL api calls on mobilizon

## config
- copy config.sample.php to config.php
- replace startvalues, put in your mobilizon URl, and if needed your user email and password

see test.php to make some basic calls

everything in this repo is ugly and bad written because we just want to check how to access the mobilizon api
